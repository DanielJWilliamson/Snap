# Snap
Snap Game python.

This is my submission for the Snap game part of the test. 

Points I would like to look at, firstly general organisation of the code (if you have any advice on better ways to orgnaise the solution / tips on how better to approach the solution.)

Ugly parts of code that I would like to look at, (the run simulation method and in general if there is a nicer / better method to loop through the players cards to decide the winning piles).

Also any tips on how better to approach the problem logically, or organise the code better would be greatly appreciated. 

No requirements written in python 3.8.0 with inbuilt packages.

Please let me know if you have any issues at all.

Thank you,
Daniel Williamson
